##WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LEMP STACK)


##Deploying a LEMP Stack Application On AWS Cloud

Deploying a LEMP stack application on the AWS Cloud is a robust and flexible way to host web applications. The LEMP stack, consisting of Linux as the operating system, Nginx as the web server, MySQL as the database system, and PHP for server-side scripting, is a popular choice for web developers. AWS offers a range of services and tools to streamline the deployment process.

Steps to Deploy:

1. Set Up AWS Account: If you don't have one, create an AWS account to access AWS services.

2. Launch an EC2 Instance: Use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) to launch a virtual server (EC2 instance) running a Linux-based operating system (e.g., Amazon Linux or Ubuntu).

3. Secure Your Instance: Configure security groups and key pairs to control access to your EC2 instance. SSH into the instance for further setup.

4. Update and Install LEMP Components: Update the package list and install the LEMP stack components.

##Creating an Ubuntu EC2 Instance

Login to AWS Cloud Service console and create an Ubuntu EC2 instance. The virtual machine is a Linux operating system that is the backbone of the LEMP Stack web application.
